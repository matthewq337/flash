# Flash
form input so fast, it seems like a flash

flash is a free and open-source flask input that stores the user input in a sqlite db written in python.

flash is:

* feature-rich and extensible, both with the cli and the flask version;
* scalable and suitable for both small and large sites;
* simple to install, working on most hardware/software combinations;

## Getting Started
1) git clone the repo
2) edit the .env to include your email and generate a app password if using [gmail](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833)
3) edit the smtp server if you don't gmail






## Requirements

SQLite 3.7.15 or newer per [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)
